Write about any difficult problem that you solved. (According to us difficult - is something which 90% of people would have only 10% probability in getting a similarly good solution). 

Answer: If i would be specific about, handling 2 major projects of end-to-end machine learning project along with deployment i.e, Flight Fare Prediction [https://flight1645.herokuapp.com/] and Bike share prediction system [https://bikesharepred7845.herokuapp.com/] was something chellanging, as it was a fully automated end-to-end ML project along with maintaing logs. While most of us to a step back, I chellanged myself to complete it in the span of a month. Altough, Flight Fare Prediction [https://github.com/Aaric-hub/flight] got completed in the time given, the evaluation of Bike share prediction [https://github.com/Aaric-hub/Bike_Share_New] took me 7days extra to submit. I was happy that my mentor appreciated for completing it stand-alone.
